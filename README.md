## QR Code Only - Description

Hello there! Old man here, just a guy trying to help out in a small way in the big internet world.

Maybe you have the same experience i had.  I got tired of all the trackers and unnecessary logins required to simply and quickly make a QR code online from a website URL.

Some sites:
* Require a login
* Add their own trackers
* Only allow the QR code to work for a short period of time (like 180 days)
* Only allow the QR code to work while you have an active subscription to their service (looking at you, Adobe)
* Require that you sign up for their paid subscriptions
* Have business models that want to use your data for other purposes
* Redirect the user to an ad or app when they use the QR code.

Let's change all that.

Let's simply make a website that only does one thing: uses the URL or text you enter into a field and convertd it directly to a QR code that can be downloaded, saved, and used in your print projects.

No hidden trackers, no subscriptions, no logins, no expiration dates, no data mining. Just a simple conversion from text to a QR code image. Download the image for free and use it as long as the QR code standard remains in place by the general internet world and as long as your URL domain stays in business.

This website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The QR code generation is handled by the qrcodejs JavaScript library. The code runs in your client-side browser - not on our server. 

We are not using any tools to capture your data. Enjoy this free service.  

You can donate to show your appreciation.
